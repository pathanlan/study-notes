> As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared.

(Cut from text)
The good teams:
1. > ...(had) members (who) spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as "equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking."
2. > ...(had) high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.

> Within psychology, researchers sometimes colloquially refer to traits like ‘‘conversational turn-taking’’ and ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ as aspects of what’s known as psychological safety — a group culture that the Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson defines as a ‘‘shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.’’

Regarding team leaders:
* Good
	* > (the) team leader was ‘‘direct and straightforward, which creates a safe space for you to take risks.’’
* Not Ideal
	* > (the team leader) has poor emotional control
	* > He panics over small issues and keeps trying to grab control.

> The behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond.
