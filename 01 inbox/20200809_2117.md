The following is a quote from the article, describing how to prevent a link (i.e. tab-able element) from being tabbed to, and from a screen-reader (for accessibility reasons):

> The implementation is simple:
> 
> * Prevent a link from being tabbed by using ``tabindex = "-1"``, and 
> * Hide said link from screen readers using ``aria-hidden = "true"``, because you don’t want a screen reader to expose a link the user won’t be able to interact with.
